#### Real-Time-Intrusion-Detection-System
### An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a tool for spotting unusual activity in network traffic and sending out alerts when it is found. It is software that checks a system or network for malicious activities and detects the spam parameters using machine learning models. The IoT dataset used for experiments, is pre-processed by using feature engineering procedure. By experimenting the framework with machine learning models, each appliance is awarded with a spam score. This refines the conditions to be taken for successful working on devices in a smart home.

#### 1.Abstract:
##### Recent  advancements  in  network  technology  and  associated  services  have  led  to a  rapid  increase in data traffic. Network attacks  are  evolving in  various  forms.  An An  essential  instrument   for   monitoring   and   identifying  intrusion  threats  is  intrusion   detection   system   (IDS). The   task   is  to  build  an  intrusion  detector,  apredictive  model  capable  of  distinguishing  between  bad  intrusions  or  attacks and good   normal   connections.   We   are   proposing   an    IDS   algorithm    based    on supervised  machine  learning  methods  for  developing such an efficient  and flexible system  that  can  detect  intrusions  from  the  data  received  in  real  time. Finally, an intrusion  detection  system  based  on  the  Random  Forest  classifier  is   built   using the   optimal   training   dataset   obtained  by  data  sampling and the features selected by   feature   selection.   The   experiment   will   be   carried   out  on the CICIDS2017 dataset.  Compared   with  other  algorithms,   the  model  has  obvious  advantages  in detecting rare anomaly behaviours.

#### 2.Objective:
- Improve accuracy of the intrusion detection.
- Decrease false alarms.
- Shorten training time for intrusion detection, reduce the manual labour.
- To increase protection to the system.
  
#### Technologies :
- Machine learning
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Random forest classifier
- Decision tree

#### Problem Statement :
##### To   distinguish   the   activities   of   the   network   traffic   the   intrusion   and   normal   is very difficult and to need much time-consuming. An analyst must review all the large and wide data to find the sequence of intrusion on the network connection. Therefore, it needs a way to detect network intrusion to reflect current network traffic. The above-mentioned is achieved with the help of a real-time intrusion prevention system based on machine learning algorithms, which makes it flexible with all types of variant attacks.

#### 5.Conclusion:
##### Over this new set of data , testing and training  data are classified in order to perform regression analysis , KNN algorithms and machine learning techniques. By using decision tree learning , we will classify whether there is presence of virus or not.
